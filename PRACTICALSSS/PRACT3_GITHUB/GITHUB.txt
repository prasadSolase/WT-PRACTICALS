$git config --global user.name "xyz"
$git config --global user.email "xyz@gmail.com"

for checking cofiguration 
$git config --list

clone the remote repository to local repository as follows:

$git clone https://github.com/xyz/xyz.git

after cloning the remote repository, change the directory to local repository

$cd xyz/
$ls  :REDAME.md

to add some additional file we use touch in ubuntu for empty files for example:

$ touch hello.py 

we create python files add some data using 

$gedit hello.py  and save it..


NOW check the status of the remote repository

$git status

we found that hello.py is untrackable file.
for commit the file we use:

$git add hello.py

we add hello.py in commited path now commit the file using:

$ git commit -m "My python "

we successfully add hello.py and also commited the file, but our file is not shown in remote repository for that we 
need to push the file to the remote repository.

$git push origin main

then terminal ask our user name and password but this method is not working from augsut 2021..

so we need to use tokens to aunthentication to push the file to the remote repository

$git remote set-url origin https://<token>@github.com/username/repository.git


then now we can use any time .. $git push origin main

main is a branch in the remote repository
